1.  parse xls files
2.  get xls files and then parse them
3.  or just parse the few that I have and build up the parsing exceptions;

4.  once parsed, then create samples;
5.  then create all the samples;  

yes: goal for week 1:  create all the samples (this will take me longer than 1 day, but I've got time that week)

==========

next: align once I have all the samples:

that won't take long;

but once I have the samples, get rid of the read files and tar up the samples and copy them back to the disks.

=========
before the above:  get the disk stuff figured out;   draw a diagram or make a list or catalog of files and locations, etc...

=========

initial goals:
	figure out how to create samples and document;
	document spreadsheets and locations;

	maybe document by making soft links or by making scripts?  or just making redundant copies and documenting source;

	that's probably the easiest;

	goal:  make this reproducible;   
	once I have it figured out, I can put it on dropbox or on curtis;  or wherever. 

	initial goal 1:  
		make samples;
		that includes renaming with spreadsheet names;

	initial goal 2:  align to rbcl

next goals:
	parse alignments and get rough comparison to tf-idf analysis.


=========
	then align to other reference(s)
