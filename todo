1/12:
next goals:
     1. analyze current samples, pass on to others;
     2. organize:  cp stuff back to dropbox;  document in dropbox;  maybe have a repo with results;
     3. find rest of file: reads and spreadsheets;

next goals details:
      do tf-idf on alignments;
      cluster alignments or pca;
      or have daniel do it (or rachel)
      or ask cecile and bret

      copy results to dropbox;
      get rid of reads files

      find rest of reads and spreadsheets;
============================
From below:
but once I have the samples, get rid of the read files and tar up the samples and copy them back to the disks.
next goals:
	parse alignments and get rough comparison to tf-idf analysis.
	then align to other reference(s)



=== From 12/22/2017
Done 1.  parse xls files
Deferred 2.  get xls files and then parse them
Done 3.  or just parse the few that I have and build up the parsing exceptions;

Done 4.  once parsed, then create samples;
Deferred 5.  then create all the samples;  

It did take about a week, maybe a little more: yes: goal for week 1:  create all the samples (this will take me longer than 1 day, but I've got time that week)

==========

done: next: align once I have all the samples:

correct: that won't take long;

todo: but once I have the samples, get rid of the read files and tar up the samples and copy them back to the disks.

=========
before the above:  get the disk stuff figured out;   draw a diagram or make a list or catalog of files and locations, etc...

=========

initial goals:
	yup: figure out how to create samples and document;
	deferred: document spreadsheets and locations;

	maybe document by making soft links or by making scripts?  or just making redundant copies and documenting source;

	that's probably the easiest;

	goal:  make this reproducible;   
	once I have it figured out, I can put it on dropbox or on curtis;  or wherever. 

	yup: initial goal 1:  
		make samples;
		that includes renaming with spreadsheet names;

	yup: initial goal 2:  align to rbcl

next goals:
	parse alignments and get rough comparison to tf-idf analysis.


=========
	then align to other reference(s)
